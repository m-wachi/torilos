tredit design
1. specification
   1.1 moving cursor by up, down, left right allow key.
   1.2 printing ascii characters at the cursor then move right.
   1.3 creating new file
   1.4 opening a file and editing it.
   1.5 saving contents to a file.
   1.6 cannot move cursor to the position which doesn't exist data.
        (you cannot move to the right of 'LF')
         
2. api
   2.1 turn on 'EDITOR MODE' by ioctl()
   2.2 send message by write(). 
   2.3 TREDIT protocol is the followings
      a) 4 byte per a message.
      b) first byte means command. 
           'p': print character at the cursor.
           'd': delete character at the cursor.
           'a': move cursor by absolute positioning.
           'r': move cursor by relative positioning.
           'c': clear line at the cursor.
      c) following 3 bytes has meanings by each command.
           'p': second byte indicates a character to print.
                third byte and forth byte indicates forecolor and bgcolor.
           'd': following 3 bytes have no meaning.
           'a': second byte indicates X pos starts by 0, third byte is 
                Y pos also starts by 0.
           'r': second byte indicates X pos, third byte is Y pos.
                X=-1 means move right.
           'c': second byte indicates Y pos.

3. schedule
   3.1 implement 'EDITOR MODE' flag on console and switching by ioctl().
   3.2 display cursor at (2, 2) position.
   3.3 implement 'r' command and move left and write.
   3.4 implement 'p' command.
   3.5 implement 'd' command.
   3.6 save to a file.
   3.7 open a file. (you implement 1 line editor by here)
   3.8 print LF.
   3.9 implement 'r' command and move up down.
   3.10 implement the others.
